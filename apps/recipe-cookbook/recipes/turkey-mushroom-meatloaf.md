## Recipe Info
- **Servings:** 4–6
- **Prep Time:** 20 minutes
- **Cook Time:** 50 minutes
- **Total Time:** 1 hour 10 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground turkey (93% lean preferred)
- 8 oz mushrooms (white or cremini), finely chopped
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (plain or seasoned)
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 2 tbsp ketchup, plus more for topping
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (or substitute yellow mustard)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven** to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet or loaf pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it.

2. **Cook the vegetables:** In a medium skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and mushrooms and cook for 6–8 minutes, until the mushrooms release their moisture and the mixture looks mostly dry. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

3. **Combine ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled mushroom mixture with ground turkey, breadcrumbs, milk, egg, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, salt, pepper, and thyme. Mix gently until just combined — do not overmix.

4. **Shape the loaf:** Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and shape into a loaf. Brush the top with a thin layer of ketchup for a classic glaze.

5. **Bake:** Bake for 45–55 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).

6. **Rest and serve:** Let the meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm, optionally topped with extra ketchup or mushroom gravy.

## Tips

- Don't overmix the meat mixture to avoid a tough texture
- Let the meatloaf rest before slicing to help it hold its shape
- Use a meat thermometer to ensure proper cooking temperature
- Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days

## Ingredients

- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, pounded thin
- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 2 cups Italian breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp dried oregano

1. **Preheat oven** to 400°F (200°C). Set up breading station with three shallow dishes: flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs mixed with Parmesan, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper.

2. **Bread the chicken:** Dredge each chicken breast in flour, then egg, then breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere.

3. **Cook chicken:** Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

4. **Prepare pasta:** Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside.

5. **Assemble:** Place breaded chicken in a baking dish. Top each piece with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese.

6. **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.

7. **Serve:** Serve over pasta, garnished with fresh basil and extra Parmesan cheese.

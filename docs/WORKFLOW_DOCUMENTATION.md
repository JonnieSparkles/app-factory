# AI Agent Workflow Documentation

## Standard Workflow Steps

When working with AI agents on this project, always follow these steps in order:

### 1. Make Updates Requested
- Analyze the user's request
- Identify files that need to be modified
- Make the necessary changes
- Ensure code quality and functionality

### 2. Test If Appropriate
- Test the changes locally when possible
- Verify functionality works as expected
- Check for any errors or issues
- Use test mode for deployment testing when needed

### 3. Deploy
- Deploy the changes to the target environment
- Use the appropriate deployment method
- Verify deployment was successful
- Check deployment logs for any issues

### 4. Announce (If Prompted)
- Only announce AFTER successful deployment
- Use the Discord announcement feature
- Ensure GitHub secrets are properly configured
- Verify announcement was posted successfully

## ðŸ”„ GitHub Actions Workflow

### Auto-Merge Workflow (`auto-merge.yml`)
The auto-merge workflow now includes **smart deployment triggering**:

1. **PR Validation**: Validates the pull request
2. **Change Detection**: Checks if changes affect the `apps/` directory
3. **Auto-Merge**: Merges the PR if valid
4. **Conditional Deploy**: Only triggers deploy workflow if `apps/` changes detected

**Benefits:**
- **Resource Optimization**: Skips unnecessary deployments when only non-app files change
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces GitHub Actions usage and deployment costs
- **Efficient Workflow**: Only deploys when meaningful changes are made

### Deploy Workflow (`deploy.yml`)
The deploy workflow is now **simplified and optimized**:

1. **Triggered Conditionally**: Only runs when `apps/` changes are detected
2. **Incremental Deployment**: Uses hash-based change detection for efficiency
3. **All Apps Deployment**: Deploys all apps when triggered (since we know changes exist)
4. **Logging & Manifest Updates**: Commits deployment logs and manifests back to repo

**Key Changes:**
- Removed complex file detection logic (now handled by auto-merge)
- Simplified deployment logic (always deploys all apps when triggered)
- Maintains incremental deployment benefits within each app

### Workflow Behavior Examples

**Scenario 1: Changes to `apps/` directory**
```
1. Agent modifies apps/arcade/index.html
2. Agent creates PR
3. Auto-merge workflow detects apps/ changes
4. PR is merged
5. Deploy workflow is triggered
6. All apps are deployed using incremental detection
7. Deployment logs and manifests are committed
```

**Scenario 2: Changes to non-app files**
```
1. Agent modifies README.md or docs/
2. Agent creates PR
3. Auto-merge workflow detects no apps/ changes
4. PR is merged
5. Deploy workflow is NOT triggered
6. Resources saved, no unnecessary deployment
```

**Scenario 3: Manual deployment**
```
1. User manually triggers deploy workflow via GitHub Actions
2. Deploy workflow runs regardless of file changes
3. All apps are deployed (useful for maintenance deployments)
```

## Implementation Details

### Testing Phase
```bash
# Test deployment in test mode
node deploy.js --test-mode --file <filename> --content "<content>"

# Test Discord connection
node deploy.js --test-discord

# Test with announcement (will fail without credentials)
node deploy.js --test-mode --announce-discord --file <filename>
```

### Deployment Phase
```bash
# Deploy with content
node deploy.js --file <filename> --content "<content>"

# Deploy with announcement
node deploy.js --file <filename> --content "<content>" --announce-discord

# Deploy and trigger GitHub Actions announcement
node deploy.js --file <filename> --content "<content>" --trigger-announcement
```

### Announcement Phase
```bash
# Direct Discord announcement
node scripts/announce.js <deployment_hash> <file_path>

# GitHub Actions announcement
node scripts/trigger-announcement.js <deployment_hash> <file_path>
```

## Environment Setup Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# ArNS Configuration
ANT_PROCESS_ID=your-arns-process-id
OWNER_ARNS_NAME=your-arns-name
WALLET_ADDRESS=your-wallet-address

# Wallet Configuration (Choose one)
ARWEAVE_JWK_JSON={"kty":"RSA","e":"AQAB","n":"...","d":"..."}
# OR
ARWEAVE_WALLET_PATH=./secrets/wallet.json

# Discord Configuration (for announcements)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test before deploying** - Use test mode to verify changes
2. **Deploy before announcing** - Never announce before successful deployment
3. **Check credentials** - Ensure all required environment variables are set
4. **Monitor logs** - Check deployment and announcement logs for issues
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide clear error messages and next steps

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Wallet Not Found
- Create `./secrets/wallet.json` with valid Arweave wallet
- Or set `ARWEAVE_JWK_JSON` environment variable

### Discord 401 Error
- Check Discord webhook URL is set correctly
- Verify tokens are valid and not expired

### Deployment Fails
- Check wallet has sufficient balance
- Verify ArNS configuration is correct
- Check network connectivity

### Announcement Fails
- Verify Discord webhook URL is configured
- Check if announcement is appropriate for the deployment type
- Ensure deployment was successful before attempting announcement
